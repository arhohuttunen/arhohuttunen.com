      text: Thank you man! I saw this and previous video, and I learned a lot. I have been programming with Spring since 1 year, but I have not payed attention to testing, and now, I clearly see that it's so important and useful.

      text: Awesome, your explanation is very helpful, especially the last part, I've been struggling with a lot of annotations is used in test so far, but I get it better now, thank you!

      text: Great video! A lot of useful parts and examples, especially when it comes to testing, bad request handling etc. You don't see it often enough in most Spring tutorials. Came here to see how to use Spring with Kotlin, but I see you have a lot of videos on testing with Spring, I'll definitely come back later to see them.
