This JUnit 5 tutorial teaches us how to write and run tests for our Java and Kotlin code. The tutorial targets both beginners and people already familiar with some version of JUnit.

The articles in the tutorial have been broken down to different sections.

## Getting Started

First section teaches all the basics of JUnit 5, from the setup to making assertions, and how the test lifecycle works.

- [Writing Your First Test](/junit-5-getting-started/) - Learn to write your first JUnit 5 test. Start here if you are completely new to testing.
- [Assertions](/junit-5-assertions/) - Learn to write JUnit 5 assertions to verify tests results.
- [Nested tests](/junit-5-nested-tests/) - Learn to run code before and after each test or all tests in the test class.
- [Test Lifecycle](/junit-5-test-lifecycle/) - Learn to run code before and after each test or all tests in the test class.
- [Parameterized tests](/junit-5-parameterized-tests/) – Learn to remove duplication from test code by writing JUnit 5 parameterized tests. Use different sources of parameters to run the same test several times using different input.

## Advanced

This section consists of advanced topics like how to use different testing libraries with JUnit 5. The section consists of the following articles:

- [Using Mockito with JUnit 5](/junit-5-mockito/) - Learn how to use Mockito with JUnit 5.
- [JUnit 5 with Kotlin for Java Developers](/junit-5-kotlin/) - Learn how to write JUnit 5 tests in the Kotlin language.

Also, if you are already familiar with JUnit 4, you might be interested in:

- [Migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5](/junit-5-migration/) – Learn the steps required for migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. Run your existing JUnit 4 tests along with JUnit 5, or migrate the code to the new version.

## Configuration

- [Maven Example](/junit-5-maven-example/) – Configure Maven dependencies for writing JUnit 5 tests and Maven Surefire plugin for running them.
- [Gradle Example](/junit-5-gradle-example/) – Configure Gradle dependencies for writing JUnit 5 tests and JUnit Gradle plugin for running them.
