Hi! My name is Arho Huttunen. I am an experienced software developer living in Finland.

I believe that simplicity is the key to solving problems. I want to find simple solutions to complex problems. But not only that, I also want to turn complex problems into simple problems.

That can be hard. Really hard. We often struggle because our minds are set to work harder on a solution to a complex problem. We miss out on the easy solution because we don't see how to change the problem.

I coach and mentor other software developers to excel at their jobs. I've been doing that for a long time and love to see a spark of inspiration in their minds.
