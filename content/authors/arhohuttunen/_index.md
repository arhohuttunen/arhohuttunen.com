Hi! My name is Arho Huttunen, and I live in Finland. I am a software engineer with over 20 years of experience.
During my career I have trained and mentored a lot of people, and I feel really passionate about it.

I believe that becoming a better software engineer is a life long journey. I want to keep doing what I enjoy and
teach people how to succeed in that journey.
