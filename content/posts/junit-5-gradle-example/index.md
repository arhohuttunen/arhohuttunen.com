summary: This guide shows how to configure Gradle for JUnit 5, including adding dependencies and enabling the JUnit platform for running tests. It covers both modern Gradle versions with native support and older versions using the JUnit Gradle plugin. By the end, you'll be able to run JUnit 5 tests successfully in your Gradle projects.

In this JUnit 5 Gradle example, we will learn how to get the required dependencies for writing JUnit 5 tests with Gradle. Also, we will learn how to configure the JUnit Gradle plugin to run the tests.

This article is part of the [JUnit 5 Tutorial](/junit-5-tutorial).

## Required dependencies

First, to be able to write JUnit 5 tests we need the `junit-jupiter` artifact as a dependency in `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.8.0")
}
```

Now all we need is to tell to use the JUnit platform in the tests:

```gradle
test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

Now we have the most basic setup for writing and running JUnit 5 tests with Gradle.

### Configuration for Older Versions

Beginning from JUnit Jupiter 5.4.0 there is now an aggregator artifact `junit-jupiter` that transitively pulls in dependencies on `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-params`, and `junit-jupiter-engine` for simplified dependency management. This means that we don't need additional dependencies to be able to write parameterized tests.

To be able to write JUnit 5 tests using an older version we need the `junit-jupiter-api` artifact as a dependency. We also need the JUnit Jupiter test engine in the test runtime classpath:

```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.3.2")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.3.2")    
}
```

Beginning from Gradle 4.6 there is now native support for JUnit Jupiter. When using Gradle 4.5 or older, to be able to run JUnit 5 tests we have to configure the JUnit Gradle plugin:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.junit.platform:junit-platform-gradle-plugin:1.3.2'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.junit.platform.gradle.plugin'
```

Now we have the setup for writing and running JUnit 5 tests with older versions of Gradle.

## Running tests

The JUnit Gradle plugin discovers tests under `src/test/java` directory by default.

Let’s check if our configuration works by adding a very simple test that does nothing:

```java
class GradleExampleTest {

    @Test
    void shouldRun() {

    }
}
```

Now we can run our tests on the command line with:

```
$ gradle test
```

We should see output similar to this:

```
:test
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
```

There we go! JUnit Gradle plugin is now running our tests.

## Summary

In this JUnit 5 Gradle example we have learned how to add the required dependency for writing JUnit 5 tests and how to configure JUnit Gradle plugin to be able to run the tests.
